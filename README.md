# ccnbrowser

Our CCN Browser is based on open source qtwebkit project. 
How do we add CCN protocol to the qtwebkit?
We refer to an article named "Adding New Protocols to QtWebKit",
which tells us how to add ftp protocol to the qtwebkit.
So,you can google for the article and read carefully.

If you want use our CCN Browser, you can use the code we provide. And if you don't
know how to build the CCN Browser, you can also see the pdf named "Installation of CCN Browser",
which is already given by us.

Thanks for using our browser.
